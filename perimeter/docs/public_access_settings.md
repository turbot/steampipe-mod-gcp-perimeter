## Public Access Settings

The public access settings benchmark evaluates GCP resources for potential exposure to the internet through their configuration settings. This includes checking:

### Network Configuration
- Public IP addresses on compute instances
- Public endpoints on managed services
- Firewall rules allowing unrestricted access
- VPC connectivity settings

### Resource Types Evaluated

The benchmark checks configuration settings on the following resource types:
- Compute Engine instances
- Cloud Functions
- Cloud Run services
- GKE clusters
- Cloud SQL instances
- Memorystore instances
- VPC firewall rules

### Risk Assessment

Public access through configuration settings can pose several risks:
- Direct internet accessibility to resources
- Increased attack surface
- Network-level vulnerabilities
- Bypass of security controls
- Potential data exposure

### Best Practices

To minimize risks from configuration-based public access:
- Use private IP addresses where possible
- Configure VPC connectors for serverless services
- Enable private endpoints for managed services
- Use Cloud NAT for outbound internet access
- Restrict firewall rules to specific IP ranges
- Use internal load balancers for internal service access
- Implement bastion hosts or Identity-Aware Proxy for administrative access
- Enable Private Google Access for API access
- Use VPC Service Controls to restrict service perimeter
