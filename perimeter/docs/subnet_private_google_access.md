# Subnet Private Google Access

This control checks whether subnets have Private Google Access enabled.

## Overview

Private Google Access allows VM instances in a subnet to reach Google APIs and services without using external IP addresses. This improves security by keeping traffic to Google services within Google's network.

## Remediation

1. Enable Private Google Access for a subnet:
   ```bash
   gcloud compute networks subnets update SUBNET_NAME \
     --region=REGION \
     --enable-private-ip-google-access
   ```

2. Best practices for Private Google Access:
   - Enable for all subnets that need Google API access
   - Use in conjunction with Cloud NAT for other internet access
   - Configure firewall rules appropriately
   - Monitor API access patterns

3. Additional considerations:
   - Use VPC Service Controls for additional security
   - Implement proper IAM roles
   - Use Private Service Connect where appropriate
   - Regular audit of network configurations
