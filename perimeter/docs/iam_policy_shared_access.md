# IAM Policy Shared Access

IAM policies should be carefully managed to prevent unintended sharing of resources across projects and organizations. This benchmark evaluates IAM policies across various GCP services to identify resources that are shared with external entities.

IAM policies control who has what access to your GCP resources. When resources are shared through IAM policies with external entities (service accounts, users, groups, or domains), it increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches. This benchmark helps identify such shared access to ensure it aligns with your security requirements.
