## Public Access

The public access benchmark evaluates GCP resources for potential exposure to the internet through various configurations. This includes checking:

### Categories

- **Public Access Compute**: Evaluates compute resources like GCE instances, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run services, and GKE clusters for public exposure through IP addresses and network configurations.
- **Public Access Database**: Checks database resources like Cloud SQL and Memorystore instances for public IP addresses and network settings that could allow public access.
- **Public Access Network**: Assesses network configurations like firewall rules that might allow unrestricted access from the internet.

### Resource Types Evaluated

The benchmark evaluates the following resource types:
- Compute Engine instances
- Cloud Functions
- Cloud Run services
- GKE clusters
- Cloud SQL instances
- Memorystore instances
- VPC firewall rules

### Risk Assessment

Public access to cloud resources can pose several risks:
- Increased attack surface for potential threats
- Direct internet accessibility to sensitive resources
- Bypass of network security controls
- Potential data exfiltration paths

### Best Practices

To minimize public exposure risks:
- Use private IP addresses where possible
- Configure VPC connectors for serverless services
- Enable private endpoints for managed services
- Implement bastion hosts or Identity-Aware Proxy for administrative access
- Use Cloud NAT for outbound internet access
- Restrict firewall rules to specific IP ranges
- Use internal load balancers for internal service access
- Implement VPC Service Controls where appropriate
