# Firewall Allow All Ingress

This control identifies firewall rules that allow unrestricted ingress access from any source (0.0.0.0/0).

## Overview

Firewall rules that allow unrestricted ingress access from any source pose significant security risks. Such rules should be carefully reviewed and replaced with more restrictive rules that follow the principle of least privilege.

## Remediation

1. Delete overly permissive firewall rules:
   ```bash
   gcloud compute firewall-rules delete RULE_NAME
   ```

2. Create more restrictive rules:
   ```bash
   gcloud compute firewall-rules create RULE_NAME \
     --direction=INGRESS \
     --priority=1000 \
     --network=NETWORK \
     --action=ALLOW \
     --rules=tcp:PORT \
     --source-ranges=TRUSTED_IP_RANGES
   ```

3. Best practices for firewall rules:
   - Use specific source IP ranges
   - Limit allowed ports to only those needed
   - Use service accounts and network tags
   - Document the purpose of each rule
   - Regularly audit firewall rules
