# Network Access Benchmark

## Overview

The Network Access benchmark evaluates the security of your GCP network configurations. Proper network security is crucial for protecting resources from unauthorized access and maintaining visibility into network traffic.

## Categories of Controls

### Firewall Controls
- **Firewall Allow All Ingress**: Identifies firewall rules that allow unrestricted ingress access from any source.

### VPC Controls
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Ensures VPC flow logs are enabled for network traffic monitoring and security analysis.
- **Private Google Access**: Verifies that subnets have Private Google Access enabled for secure API access.

## Best Practices

1. **Firewall Configuration**
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Document all firewall rules
   - Regularly review and audit firewall configurations
   - Use service accounts and network tags for targeted rules

2. **Network Monitoring**
   - Enable VPC flow logs for all networks
   - Set appropriate retention periods for logs
   - Configure log exports to security tools
   - Monitor for suspicious traffic patterns

3. **Network Access Control**
   - Use Private Google Access for API calls
   - Implement VPC Service Controls where appropriate
   - Use Cloud NAT for outbound internet access
   - Segment networks using subnets and firewall rules
